# Local
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.
## Dependencies
You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**
* **[Node.js 8.x LTS](https://nodejs.org/)**
* **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)**
* **[Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)** - `yarn global add ember-cli`

It is also recommended to have [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) installed to speed up the `file-watcher/auto-build` service of the ember build server.

## Steps
* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd open-event-frontend`

**Note :** If you want to contribute, first fork the original repository and clone the forked repository into your local machine followed by ```cd``` into the directory
```sh
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/open-event-frontend.git
cd open-event-frontend
```

* `yarn`
* `cp .env.example .env`
* `node scripts/l10n.js generate`

#### Important Notes
 - Open Event Frontend supports [FastBoot](https://github.com/ember-fastboot/ember-cli-fastboot) which is disabled for the development environment and is controlled by the flag `FASTBOOT_DISABLED` in the `.env` file.  

- By default, the `.env.example` file specifies the `API_HOST` as `localhost:5000` and assumes, that the [open-event-server](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server) is already up and running. If you intend to work on issues which involve both the frontend, and the backend, please install and set it up first before proceeding to run the frontend. If however, you intend to work on just the frontend, please change the URL for `API_HOST` to `https://open-event-api-dev.herokuapp.com` which is a test deployment of the open-event-server.
## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
